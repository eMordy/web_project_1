# Project #2
A completed project that shows the path of a web developer in the making.


## Working through a project
In this project, using VS code, I aplied the subjects learnt to create my very own first website:
*  BEM technology - that makes our coding a little bit easier.
*  Grid and flexbox.
*  Tables to make lists.
*  Using CSS transitions and animations.
*  iframes for videos.

## Project's execute
As someone who has never coded, I enjoyed creating this project using all the material I have learnt so far with Yandex's Practicum.
I have learnt to use HTML and CSS and by doing so I created BEM's which makes everything more organized and easy to read and use.
Also managed to make animations to move with transtions.
The sections I've created in the CSS stylesheet moved to sections inside the **blocks** folder, which inside every block was also 
a CSS file. Some have inside internal folders with more properties and modifiers.
Eventually *index.css* file is created to connect and import all of the styles so the codesheet looks more neat. 

*This is the finished project that combines both first and second sprints' assignments. hence the name web_project_1*
